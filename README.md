# python_projects
There are 100 python projects from an online python bootcamp I am taking. Twenty of the projects are data science. I am aiming to complete at least 70 of the projects. All complete projects will be in this repository. Starting with the most basic to advance projects.

Please feel free to update and modify existing projects. I would love to see how experienced devs modify these projects. 

Thank you!
